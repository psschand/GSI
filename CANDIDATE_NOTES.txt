I was not sure about task 5,need more clarity on the question, though code is partially given.

kubernetes 

$pipenv shell


>>> to run application locally
$ invoke run

>>> to run tests locally
$ invoke test

>>> to run static code analysis locally
$ flake8

to build the container
>>>docker-compose build 

to bring up the container
>>>docker-compose up

To run tests on Docker
>>>docker exec -it container-ID bash

then run "python -m unittest discover" or "pytest"
then run "flake8" for code analysis
